# Desk Calendar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/macdaddyaz/desk-calendar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/macdaddyaz/desk-calendar)

Desk Calendar is a small Angular 2 application that, cleverly enough, puts a desk calendar in your browser. It shows the months as a desk or wall calendar would, allowing navigation from month to month.

While providing real functionality, it's primary purpose is to act as a self-tutorial and test bed of some key Web application technologies:
* Angular 2
* TypeScript
* Bootstrap 4

I chose a desk calendar for a few reasons. For one, I'm fascinated by time and dates and calendars. Also, it's a nice simple problem domain that I understand well. At the same time, it presents some interesting implementation challenges.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following dependencies installed on your system:
1. [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation)

After installation, ensure that the `ng` command is available on your PATH.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
