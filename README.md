Desk Calendar
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/macdaddyaz/desk-calendar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/macdaddyaz/desk-calendar)

Desk Calendar is a small application that, cleverly enough, puts a desk calendar in your browser. It shows the months as a desk or wall calendar would, allowing navigation from month to month.

While providing real functionality, it's primary purpose is to act as a self-tutorial and test bed of some modern web development technologies.

I chose a desk calendar for a few reasons. For one, I'm fascinated by time and dates and calendars. Also, it's a nice simple problem domain that I understand well. At the same time, it presents some interesting implementation challenges.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
